# Angular_API_ConsumptionDemo
This project demonstrates how to consume a .NET Web API using Angular. It shows API integration through different components like listing, adding, and editing employees. Data is fetched and updated using Angular's HttpClient module. The UI is styled neatly with Bootstrap for better visualization.
